## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
wta <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/36-SURE/36-SURE.github.io/main/data/wta_grand_slam_matches.csv")
```

```{r}
head(wta)

dim(wta)

#idea 1: if the match goes to a third set, who is more likely to win, the person who won the first set or the second set?

#idea 2: are you more likely to come back from losing the first set if you lose by 2-3 or 4-6

#idea 3: do lefties have more aces or righties (against percentage of lefties v righties)

#idea 4: do games furhter in the tournament have higher set totals



wta2<- wta |> separate(score, sep=" ", c("match_1", "match_2", "match_3"))

head(wta2)
wta2<- wta |> 
  mutate(avg_age = (loser_age+winner_age)/2) |> 
  mutate(total_aces = l_ace+w_ace)

time_table <- wta2 |> 
  group_by(round) |> 
  select(round, minutes, avg_age, total_aces) |> 
  filter(minutes != '0') |> 
  summarize(min_time = min(minutes, na.rm =TRUE),
            max_time = max(minutes, na.rm =TRUE),
            mean_time = mean(minutes, na.rm =TRUE),
            avg_age = mean(avg_age),
            avg_aces = mean(total_aces)
            ) 

  
#view(time_table)
time_table|> 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(round, mean_time), y=mean_time, color = avg_age, size=avg_aces)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  labs(
    title = "Average Time per Match by Round",
    subtitle = "With Comparisons of Average Age and Average Number of Aces (per match)",
    x = "Round",
    y = "Average Time",
